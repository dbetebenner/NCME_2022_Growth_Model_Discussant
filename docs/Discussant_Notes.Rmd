# Empirical Best Linear Prediction

--

- An excellent set of presentations/paper.

--

- A major contribution to the way in which states and other organizations should consider aggregating individual growth scores.

--

- I commend the authors for creating a GitHub based R package ([schoolgrowth](https://github.com/jrlockwood/schoolgrowth)) with the non-trivial analytics.

# Presentation 1:

## Improving Accuracy and Stability of Aggregate Student Growth Measures Using Empirical Best Linear Prediction

--

- Results clearly show the superior of EBLP over the simple average except in a few circumstances.

--

- I found the fact that the approach does not involve shrinkage but improves accuracy to be somewhat counter-intuitive

--

- A feature of the EBLP approach that "makes it work" are the "patterns" described in the paper. Could you elaborate on exactly how patterns are defined.

---

# Presentation 2:

## Applications of the Empirical Best Linear Prediction to Aggregate Growth Measures in Two States

--

- Excellent stress test of the approach using real data

--

- Comparison showing increasing stability including additional subjects and lag scores was compelling

--

- The Decision Points that were laid out at the end of the presentation are well stated and highly practical

---

# Presentation 3:

## Adopting a Growth Measure in California

--

- Great to see California moving forward (finally) to having student growth.

--

- Their journey is illustrative of the numerous pitfalls that can accompany assessment and accountability initiatives.

--

- I'm curious. You mention in 2018 during your review that the growth model did not "Provide the answers/information that our various educational partners wanted". What answers/information did the partners want.

# Overall Comments

--

- Growth aggregation methods:

--

	- Started with median

--

	- Percentage of observations above some threshold

--

	- Mean

--

	- EBLP


- IMHO there's a inverse relationship between the technical soundness of the aggregation approach and ease of communcating to non-technical audiences.

--

- Data as flashlight instead of a hammer (accountability)

--

- Would this technique be amenable to any data. For example student scaled scores? (as a substitute for percent proficient)
